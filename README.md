# Classification algorithm implementation

`classificationExample.py` shows a basic example of how the classifiers were implemented in this work. Input data is read from the `./data` folder, and confusion matrices are output into a log file and onto `classificationImgs`. Lines 75-339 show the function definitions for the four classification algorithms. The most crucial components are listed under `# procedure`, corresponding to the label prediction implementation.
